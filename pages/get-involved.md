The quickest and easiest way to get involved is to come to one of our meetings. You can find out about any future meetings on our [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/youthforclimateluxembourg/), or on our [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/youthforclimatelux).

If you are part of an organisation or press group and would like to get involved in a different way, please get in touch by email: [youthforclimateluxembourg@gmail.com](mailto:youthforclimateluxembourg@gmail.com)
