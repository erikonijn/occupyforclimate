### AUTO-FESTIVAL


On the 30th of January, we are organizing an action in front of the Garage M. Losch Bonnevoie within the framework of the car festival that is currently taking place in Luxembourgish garages. We’re planning to be there from 10am - 12am, at 78, 90 Route de Thionville, 2610 Luxembourg.

**This action is dedicated against the car industry and the accompanying advertising.** Especially in times of a global pandemic, holding such an event is fraught with risk and endangers the health of our community. Moreover, it is questionable that this festival of all things can take place when all other events and major gatherings have been cancelled due to the COVID19 crisis. **From the perspective of the climate crisis, this festival represents an even greater threat.**

It cannot be that such climate-damaging products are promoted in this way. We claim that serious steps need to be taken in the direction of climate policy and that each decision taken is completely in line with the Paris Climate Agreement: **We need to keep the rise of global temperatures below 1.5 °C.**

Our aim on Saturday is to make people aware of the negative consequences of their potential new purchase and to raise their awareness, as well as point at the failures of the auto industry. CO2 emissions have increased again during 2017 to 2019, reaching 122.4 grams of CO2 per kilometer. These numbers are above the EU target of 95 g CO2/km that phases-in this year.

The reasons for the increase in car emissions include the growing share of the sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment. Carbon emissions fell across all sectors in 2020 except for one - SUVs. It’s even estimated that SUVs have seen a slight increase of 0.5%. The market penetration of electric cars however remained slow in 2019.
