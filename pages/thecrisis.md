**Our house is on fire.** The climate crisis is an emergency but we’re not acting like it. People everywhere are at risk if we let oil, coal and gas companies continue to pour more fuel on the fire.

**Our hotter planet is already hurting millions of people.** If we don’t act now to transition fairly and swiftly away from fossil fuels to 100% renewable energy access for all, the injustice of the climate crisis will only get worse.

**We need to act right now to stop burning fossil fuels** and ensure a rapid energy revolution with equity, reparations and climate justice at its heart.

The climate crisis won’t wait, so neither will we.
