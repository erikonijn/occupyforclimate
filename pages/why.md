***We are facing a climate emergency.*** Our very own future lives are at stake. The government doesn't take the necessary measures to tackle climate breakdown.

If the truth (science and common sense) are not enough to make you realise urgent and radical action on climate change is necessary then we have no other choice than to disobey to oblige the government to react. We cannot stay calm in the face of climate change and all the repercussions it will have on our lives and our children's lives.

Our goals are to:
 - **annoy:** to get the attention and show our dissatisfaction
 - **mobilise:** to create a movement, to empower more and stronger action amongst the People, and to raise solidarity between citizens
 - **pressure:** to make the government take action.
 
 We believe an act of **non-violent civil disobedience** cannot and will not go unnoticed. Join the action and be part of the change!
