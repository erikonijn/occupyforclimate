### 20 September: Youth-led Climate Strike

**What is it?**  
Students do not go to school and strike in the streets to express their anger towards large-scale inaction on climate change. Adults are encouraged to join the student strike; more people is more pressure! This strike is organised by YfCL. 3 days before the climate actionn UN Summit (taking place on September 23rd), we need to make our voices heard!
**When, where, how?**  
Join us on Friday 20th September at 10h in front of the Central train station. We will be marching through the city (add link to route) and finish in the Kinekskwiss, where we will have artists perform and some speeches.

### 20-27 September: Climate Action Week

**What is it?**  
Every day of the week a different action group or NGO will have some kind of action planned. This can range from a festival to a tree planting event to a civil disobedience action. There will be something for everyone!  
**When, where, how?**

### 27 September: General Climate Strike

After months of student led mobilisations, a Luxembourgish climate coalition made up of different NGOs, activist groups and unions is calling for a mass demonstration in Luxembourg. In order to show that not only students are worried about the climate crisis, we need everyone to join the marches on September 27th.  
**When, where, how?**  
On September 27th between 3 and 4pm, marches will start from different places in the city and meet up in the political centre of Luxembourg. [See here for the 27 September Facebook event!](https://www.facebook.com/events/412873679356531/)
