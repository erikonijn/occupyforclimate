The action on 24 May will be a _non-violent civil disobedience action_:

- **non-violent:** we will not be using active force or be agressive, instead using the power of the People to fight for change
- **civil disobedience:** aiming to disrupt the status-quo by disobeying, and calling attention to the climate catastrophe
- **action:** organising and getting active with other people in our communities to bring change.

We will gather at **Place de l'Europe** on May 24th at 3 in the afternoon, where you will be given further instructions. More info coming soon.
