<em> **Support the Climate Movement!** </em>

Do you want to support the Youth For Climate movement? You can help us a lot with your donation! Every strike and every action needs a budget.

The easiest way to support us is by going to our [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/20th-of-september-action-funding).

If you instead want to make a bank transfer, here is how:

1. Make a donation to the following account:  
   **BCEELULL / IBAN LU84 0019 1000 3694 4000**
2. Indicate _"YOUTH FOR CLIMATE LUXEMBOURG"_ or _"Donation for YFCL"_ in the communication
3. That's it!
 
 Thank you for your support! If you want to do even more, you can always [get involved](get-involved).
