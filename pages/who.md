Youth for Climate Luxembourg is a youth-led movement of climate strikes. We go on school strike to demand urgent political action on the climate crisis. We are part of the international climate strike movement, we are apartisan and decentralised.

All who join us on the streets are part of the climate strike movement. All who want to help organise are welcome to join our weekly meetings (find out more [here](/get-involved))

In Luxembourg we have been striking since 15th of March 2019, gathering thousands of protestors in the streets. However, even after garthering a considerable amount of media and political attention, greenhouse gas emissions are still on the rise and we can’t see the needed change - Time is running out, we need you!
