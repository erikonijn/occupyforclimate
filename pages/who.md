### Who is welcome?

Everyone! Everyone is welcome to participate. The movement is not just for students - **we are also calling upon parents, teachers, workers, adults, and anyone who lives in or around Luxembourg to join us.**

### Who is organising this?

The Occupy for Climate action is part of a global movement of climate activism fighting for a better future. A number of groups are helping organise this action, among which is Youth for Climate Luxembourg. We are a student-run organisation representing the younger generation in a conversation where we are regularly left out: the conversation about our future. We previously organised the student strike on March 15th, where around 15,000 students came together to make their voices heard.
